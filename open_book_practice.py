# 7. You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go
# off in 51 hours. At what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you could
# count on your fingers, but this is not what weâ€™re after. If you are
# tempted to count on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.)

# answer is contained in solution to next problem

# 8. Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above
# problem. Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and ask for the
# number of hours to wait. Your program should output what the time will
# be on the clock when the alarm goes off.

#! /usr/bin/env python3

# exercises 7 and 8 - compute the time in n hours, starting from 2pm



# Diff Version Found Online:

# n = int(input("How many hours: "))
# days = n//24
# timeafter = n%24
# if(timeafter > 10):
#     days = days + 1
#     hours = timeafter - 10
# else:
#     hours = timeafter + 14

# print("End time is in: ", days, "days at", hours, ":00 hours")

wake_time = (time_now + alarm_time) % 24

print(wake_time)
